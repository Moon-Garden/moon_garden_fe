<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

The tradition of lunar gardening has been practiced for as long as folks have been planting seeds and working the soil. It is believed by many cultures that the combination of the illumination of the moon and gravitational effect of the moon on earth's waters impact the gardening process. Moon Garden gives recommendations based on the various phases of the moon and provides garden tracking services for users.

When working with the land it is important to acknowledge who's land it is that is being worked. If you're curious about the history of your land, checkout our Land Acknowledgment page - link - gracefully provided by: link

Using __Moon Garden__, users are able to:

- Register or sign-in using Google OAuth.
- See the current lunar phase with the corresponding gardening recommendation.
- Create Gardens to display on their Garden Dashboard.
- Search for plants by keyword and receive growing recommendations, then add plants and their recommendation to a garden.
- Add personal track planting details to each plant in a user's garden. 
- View land acknowledgments based on IP address location.

   ```shell
   $ git clone git@github.com:Moon-Garden/moon_garden_fe.git
   ```
2. Once cloned, you will have local copies of the directories you ran the clone command in. Use `$ cd` to  navigate to the front end application directory.
   ```shell
   $ cd moon_garden_fe
   ```
3. Install the required gems utilizing Bundler: 
  - If Bundler is not installed, first run the following command.

    ```shell
    $ gem install bundler
    ```
   - If Bundler is already installed or after you have installed it, run the following command.

      ```shell
      $ bundle install
      ```
4. There should be be text diplayed of the installation process that looks similar to below.

    ```shell
    Fetching gem metadata from https://rubygems.org/........
