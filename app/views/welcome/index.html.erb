      <p>The tradition of lunar gardening has been practiced for as long as folks have been planting seeds and working the soil. It is believed by many cultures that the combination of the illumination of the moon and gravitational effect of the moon on
        earths waters impact the gardening process. Moon Garden gives recommendations based on the various phases of the moon and provides garden tracking services for users.</p>
